Semiconductor nanowires (NWs) with strong Rashba spin-orbit coupling (RSOC), when exposed to a suitably applied Zeeman field, exhibit one-dimensional helical channels with a spin orientation locked to the propagation direction within the magnetic energy gap. Here, by adopting a scattering-matrix approach applied to a tight-binding model of the NW, we demonstrate that the thermoelectric (TE) properties can be widely controlled by tuning the misalignment angle $φ$ between the spin-orbit directions of two NW segments. In particular, when the RSOC vectors are antiparallel (Dirac paradox configuration) we predict a significant violation of the Wiedemann-Franz law, and a strong enhancement of the Seebeck coefficient and the $ZT$ figure of merit. We also show that the Zeeman gap determines the optimal energy window for doping and temperatures. These results suggest that controlling the spin-orbit field direction, which can be achieved with suitably applied wrap gates, is a promising alternative for tuning and optimizing the TE response in quantum-coherent semiconducting NW devices.

## Molecular Dynamics Simulation of Hydrodynamic Transport Coefficients in Plasmas

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>

Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are used to calculate transport coefficients in a two-component plasma interacting through a repulsive Coulomb potential. The thermal conductivity, electrical conductivity, electrothermal coefficient, thermoelectric coefficient, and shear viscosity are computed using the Green-Kubo formalism over a broad range of Coulomb coupling strength, $0.01 \leq Γ\leq 140$. Emphasis is placed on testing standard results of the Chapman-Enskog solution in the weakly coupled regime ($Γ\ll 1$) using these first-principles simulations. As expected, the results show good agreement for $Γ\lesssim 0.1$. However, this agreement is only possible if careful attention is paid to the definitions of linear constitutive relations in each of the theoretical models, a point that is often overlooked. For example, the standard Green-Kubo expression for thermal conductivity is a linear combination of thermal conductivity, electrothermal and thermoelectric coefficients computed in the Chapman-Enskog formalism. Meaningful results for electrical conductivity are obtained over the full range of coupling strengths explored, but it is shown that potential and virial components of the other transport coefficients diverge in the strongly coupled regime ($Γ\gg 1$). In this regime, only the kinetic components of the transport coefficients are meaningful for a classical plasma.

## Plasma hydrodynamics from mean force kinetic theory

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>

Mean force kinetic theory is used to evaluate the electrical conductivity, thermal conductivity, electrothermal coefficient, thermoelectric coefficient, and shear viscosity of a two-component (ion-electron) plasma. Results are compared with molecular dynamics simulations. These simulations are made possible by assuming a repulsive Coulomb force for all interactions. Good agreement is found for all coefficients up to a Coulomb coupling strength of $Γ\approx 20$. This is over 100-times larger than the coupling strength at which traditional theories break down. It is concluded that mean force kinetic theory provides a means to extend hydrodynamics to dense plasmas.

## A Brief Perspective on Piezotronic and Thermoelectric Coupling: Flexible Platforms for Synergistic Energy Scavenging and Peltier-Caloric Effects

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>

Advances in the development of flexible piezoelectric and thermoelectric materials have provided an important avenue for the exploration of energy scavenging through the thermodynamic-coupling of orthogonal energy-scavenging modalities. This has led to a body of work creating hybrid thermo/piezo-electric generator devices (T/PEGs) in which the two effects become thermodynamically entangled. Based on hetero- thin film architectures, such devices can exhibit a surprising power generation characteristic which is non-additive between the two energy-scavenging effects. For example, when the thermoelectric and piezoelectric effects are strongly coupled by their proximal fields, the efficacy of energy scavenging can be made to exceed that of the two effects independently. In this review of such effects, a basic coupled heat engine model is shown to provide insight into the origins of synergistic power generation. These models however, suggest the emergence of other combined thermodynamic properties such as the kinetic Peltier-Caloric Effect (PCE) traced to Onsager reciprocity. The recent observation of this effect in multicomponent systems is confirmation of the limited perspective of thermodynamic separability.

## Topological end state and enhanced thermoelectric performance of a supramolecular device

Supramolecular device (SMD) with topological end states and a noncovalent junction is rarely investigated but deemed promising for thermoelectric (TE) applications. We designed a new kind of SMD based on the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chains, and calculated TE properties of it using the non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) method. By scaling TE performance under different optimization conditions, we found the best scenario. Our result shows that the existing topological end states indeed give rise to a large value of power factor, rendering a dimensionless figure-of-merit ZT above 2 in a broad range of chemical potential (doping). Moreover, by imposing the system to various perturbations including end state shift, structural change and disorder, we found that the SMD system possesses a prominent switch effect, further optimizing its performance for TE applications.

## Designing new Zintl phases SrBaX (X = Si, Ge, Sn) for thermoelectric applications using \textit{ab initio} techniques

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>

Slack's phonon-glass and electron-crystal concept has been the guiding paradigm for designing new thermoelectric materials. Zintl phases, in principle, have been shown as great contenders of the concept and thereby good thermoelectric candidates. With this as motivation, we design new Zintl phases SrBaX (X = Si, Ge, Sn) using state-of-the-art computational methods. Herein, we use first-principles simulations to provide key theoretical insights to thermal and electrical transport properties. Some of the key findings of our work feature remarkably low lattice thermal conductivities ($<$~1~W~m$^{-1}$~K$^{-1}$), putting proposed materials among the well-known thermoelectric materials such as SnSe and other contemporary Zintl phases. We ascribe such low values to antibonding states induced weak bonding in the lattice and intrinsically weak phonon transport, resulting in low phonon velocities, short lifetimes, and considerable anharmonic scattering phase spaces. Besides, our results on electronic structure and transport properties reveal tremendous performance of SrBaGe ($ZT\sim$ 2.0 at 700~K), highlighting the relevance among state-of-the-art materials such as SnSe. Further, the similar performances for both $p$- and $n$-type dopings render these materials attractive from device fabrication perspective. We believe that our study would invite experimental investigations for realizing the true thermoelectric potential of SrBaX series.

## Plasmon resonance in a sub-THz graphene-based detector: theory and experiment

We present a combined experimental and theoretical study of photovoltage generation in a bilayer graphene (BLG) transistor structure exposed to subterahertz radiation. The device features a global bottom and split top gate, enabling independent control of the band gap and Fermi level, thereby enabling the formation of a tunable p-n junction in graphene. Measurements show that the photovoltage arises primarily through a thermoelectric mechanism driven by heating of the p-n junction in the middle of the channel. We also provide a theoretical justification for the excitation of two-dimensional plasmons at a record-low frequency of 0.13 THz, which manifests itself as characteristic oscillations in the measured photovoltage. These plasmonic resonances, activated by a decrease in charge carrier concentration due to opening of the band gap, lead to a local enhancement of the electromagnetic field and an increase in the carrier temperature in the junction region. The record-low frequency of plasmon resonance is enabled by the low carrier density achievable in the bilayer graphene upon electrical induction of the band gap.

## Phonon-Dominated Thermal Transport and Large Violation of the Wiedemann-Franz Law in Topological Semimetal CoSi

- **DOI:** [https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2511.06290](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2511.06290)

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>

The Wiedemann-Franz (WF) law, relating the electronic thermal conductivity ($κ_{\rm e}$) to the electrical conductivity, is vital in numerous applications such as in the design of thermoelectric materials and in the experimental determination of the lattice thermal conductivity ($κ_{\rm L}$). While the WF law is generally robust, violations are frequently observed, typically manifesting in a reduced Lorenz number ($L$) relative to the Sommerfeld value ($L_0$) due to inelastic scattering. Here, we report a pronounced departure from the WF law in the topological semimetal CoSi, where the electronic Lorenz number ($L_{\rm e}$) instead rises up to $\sim40\%$ above $L_0$. We demonstrate that this anomaly arises from strong bipolar diffusive transport, enabled by topological band-induced electron-hole compensation, which allows electrons and holes to flow cooperatively and additively enhance the heat current. Concurrently, we unveil that the lattice contribution to thermal conductivity is anomalously large and becomes the dominant component below room temperature. As a result, if $κ_{\rm L}$ is assumed negligible -- as conventional in metals, the resulting $L$ from the total thermal conductivity ($κ_{\rm tot}=κ_{\rm L}+κ_{\rm e}$) deviates from $L_0$ by more than a factor of three. Our work provides deeper insight into the unconventional thermal transport physics in topological semimetals.

We study the charge transport and thermoelectric properties of the junction, comprising double quantum dot embedded in T-shaped geometry on the interface between two normal/ferromagnetic electrodes and superconducting lead. We show that the interdot coupling plays major role in controlling the local and nonlocal transport properties of this setup. For the weak interdot coupling limit, we obtain the interferometric (Fano-type) lineshapes imprinted in the quasiparticle spectra, conductances and Seebeck coefficients. In contrast, for the strong interdot coupling, we predict that the local and nonlocal transport coefficients are primarily dependent on the molecular Andreev bound states induced by superconducting proximity effect, simultaneously in both quantum dots.

## High Thermoelectric Cooling Performance of Junction Thermoelectric Transistors

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>

To achieve high performance thermoelectric materials and devices, thermoelectric transistors, which integrate thermoelectric effects with transistor technology, represent a promising approach. Here p type Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3 and n type Bi2Te2.97Se0.03 are used as the constituent materials for an NPN transistor. By applying forward bias to the emitter and reverse bias to the collector to form a common-base triode configuration, the thermoelectric effect, transistor effect, and interfacial effects within the NPN heterostructure are coupled. This NPN heterostructure induces temperature increase (heat release) at the forward biased end and temperature decrease (heat absorption) at the reverse biased end. Therefore, this device becomes a new type of thermoelectric transistor cooler. Furthermore, a DC equivalent circuit method is introduced to analyze the cooling performance of the thermoelectric transistor cooler. The results show that when the emitter voltage of the NPN thermoelectric transistor cooler is 0.01925V, the collector voltage is 0.2124V, the corresponding base region width is 0.17nm, the maximum temperature difference of 242.89K can be obtained. Even if the base region width is limited to a level of 10 nanometers, for example when the base region width is 12.78nm, the maximum temperature differenced can still reach 174.15K. The research results above indicate that the thermoelectric transistor, which synergistically combines the thermoelectric effect with transistor technology, can effectively enhance the maximum temperature difference that typical thermoelectric cooling can achieve.

## Studying the thermoelectric properties of an anisotropic QGP medium

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>

We have studied how the thermoelectric properties of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) are affected by a weak-momentum anisotropy arising from the asymptotic expansion of matter in the initial stages of ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions. The highly energetic medium produced in such collisions exhibits a notable temperature difference between its central and peripheral regions. This temperature gradient induces an electric field whose magnitude per unit temperature gradient, in the limit of vanishing electric current, defines the Seebeck coefficient of the medium. We have calculated the Seebeck coefficient for both individual quark flavors and the entire QGP medium in the presence of expansion-induced anisotropy by solving the relativistic Boltzmann transport equation in the relaxation time approximation within the kinetic theory framework. The partonic interactions are incorporated through their effective thermal masses within the quasiparticle model for an anisotropic QGP medium. We have observed that the magnitude of the Seebeck coefficient for each quark flavor as well as for the entire QGP medium increases in the presence of expansion-induced anisotropy, indicating a stronger induced electric field in the anisotropic medium compared to the isotropic case. Given that an increase in the Seebeck coefficient may lead to observable signatures such as charge asymmetries in particle distributions and to modifications in the transport behavior of the QGP, these results may provide useful input for future phenomenological studies investigating the internal structure and phase properties of the QGP in heavy-ion collisions.

## Noises in a two-channel charge Kondo model

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>

We investigate fluctuations of electric and heat currents, along with their cross-correlations, in a two-channel charge Kondo circuit driven by either a voltage bias or a temperature gradient applied across the weak link. The ratios of voltage-driven electric/heat noise to the applied voltage $V$ exhibit oscillations with the gate voltage $N$, resembling the behavior of the thermoelectric coefficient $G_T$. In contrast, the ratios of temperature-driven electric/heat noise to the temperature difference $ΔT$ vary with $N$ in a manner analogous to the thermal coefficient $G_H$ or the electric conductance $G$. The mixed noise, which is defined as the correlation function between electric and heat currents, displays behavior opposite to that of the above noises. The logarithmic temperature dependence of these noises signals non-Fermi-liquid behavior, while their oscillations with gate voltage reflect the roles of particle-hole and time-reversal symmetries in thermoelectric transport. Our results demonstrate that the fundamental relations linking voltage- and temperature-induced noises to thermoelectric transport across a tunnel junction persist beyond the Fermi-liquid paradigm.

## Outstanding figure of merit at high temperature for DFT-based predicted double perovskite oxides, Ba2GaXO6 (X = V, Nb, Ta)

Thermoelectric materials with a high figure of merit (ZT) are highly demanded for a sustainable solution to the energy crisis. In this study, we have predicted three new double perovskite oxides (DPOs), Ba2GaXO6 (X = V, Nb, Ta), with high ZT values using density functional theory (DFT) calculations and investigated their structural, electronic, thermoelectric, and mechanical properties. The electronic properties, such as electronic band structure, density of states (DOS), and charge density mapping, are used to disclose the conductive nature, chemical bonding within these compounds, which exhibit direct band gaps of 0.924, 2.354, and 3.279 eV for Ba2GaVO6, Ba2GaNbO6, and Ba2GaTaO6, respectively, as calculated using the TB mBJ potential. The thermoelectric performance of the new DPOs, Ba2GaXO6 (X = V, Nb, Ta), was assessed using the BoltzTrap2 code, which yielded outstanding ZT values of 2.36, 1.78, and 1.91 at 1500 K for Ba2GaVO6, Ba2GaNbO6, and Ba2GaTaO6, respectively, indicating their potential for waste heat management. The high ZT values are attributed to an ultra low lattice thermal conductivity, arising from strong scattering of acoustic and optical phonon modes. The changes in thermoelectric parameters with temperature were analyzed and explained.

## Applicability of Electrical Conductivity Ratio Method to Complicated Band Structure and the Carrier Scattering Mechanisms of SnSe

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>

The electrical conductivity ratio (ECR) method can be used to analyze carrier scattering mechanism (CSM) without the need of magenetic transport measurements. In this work, the applicability of the ECR method in the analysis of complex energy band structures is discussed. Combined with the thermoelectric properties of SnSe, the feasibility using ECR method of ideal single band transport model to study the CSM of semiconductor materials with complicated band structure is studied. The results indicate that ECR method is not only applicable to idea band structure as reported before but also to the complicated band structure. The analysis results of the CSM of single crystal SnSe by ECR method using ideal single-band model agree with the carrier mobility temperature dependence in the nonphase transition temperature range. The CSM along three direction of single crystal SnSe are different because of its anisotropic crystal structure. The difference between dislocation scattering (DS) and charged impurity scattering (CIS) is that DS is always accompanied by polar optical phonon scattering (POP), such as the CSM of SnSe along b axis direction. The difference between CIS and DS can be more easily distinguished by the ECR method than the carrier mobility temperature dependent method. DS and POP might be one of the approaches to improve thermoelectric property because the scattering factor for DS or POP is larger than that of acoustic phonon scattering (APS) and alloy scattering (AS). For polycrystalline SnSe, the carrier scattering mechanisms varies with the crystal structure and the temperature. This indicates that the ECR method can better reflect the variation of carrier scattering mechanisms with temperature compared to the carrier mobility temperature dependence method.

## Molecular ink-based synthesis of Bi(SzSe1-z)(IxBr1-x) solid solutions as tuneable materials for sustainable energy applications

Quasi-one-dimensional (Q-1D) van der Waals chalcohalides have emerged as promising materials for advanced energy applications, combining tunable optoelectronic properties and composed by earth-abundant and non-toxic elements. However, their widespread application remains hindered by challenges such as anisotropic crystal growth, composition control and lack of knowledge on optoelectronic properties. A deeper understanding of the intrinsic limitations of these materials, as well as viable defect mitigation strategies like the engineering of solid solutions, is critical. This work presents a low-temperature synthesis route based on molecular ink deposition enabling direct crystallization of tunable Bi(SzSe1-z)(IxBr1-x) solid solutions without need for binary chalcogenide precursors. This approach yields phase-pure films with precise control over morphology, composition, and crystallographic orientation. XRD analysis and DFT calculations confirm the formation of homogeneous solid solutions, while optoelectronic measurements reveal the distinct roles of halogen and chalcogen anions in tuning bandgap energy and carrier type, with Se shifting downwards the conduction band. The versatility of this synthesis technique enables morphology control ranging from compact films to rod-shaped microcrystals, expanding the functional adaptability of these materials. These findings offer a foundational framework for defect engineering and the scalable integration of chalcohalides in next-generation energy technologies, including photovoltaics, photocatalysis, thermoelectrics, and chemical sensing.

## Thermoelectricity of moiré heavy fermions in MoTe2/WSe2 bilayers

Tunable Kondo lattice and heavy fermion physics have been recently reported in moiré materials, but most of the studies have focused on the electrical and magnetic properties. Quantitative thermoelectric measurements, which can reveal entropic information of the heavy fermions, have yet to be achieved. Here, we report a comprehensive thermoelectric study on the moiré heavy fermion phase realized in hole-doped angle-aligned MoTe2/WSe2 bilayers. By electrically gating the material to the Kondo lattice region of the phase diagram, we observe a sign change in the Seebeck coefficient near the Kondo coherence temperature, where the heavy fermion phase with an electron-like Fermi surface evolves into an itinerant Fermi liquid with a hole-like Fermi surface. We compare the results with the semiclassical Mott relation and discuss the observed discrepancies. In addition to the thermal dissociation of Kondo singlets in the heavy Fermi liquid, a sign change accompanied by a strong peak in the Seebeck coefficient is also observed near a Zeeman breakdown of the Kondo singlets, signaling an entropy accumulation. Our results provide entropic information on both the formation and breakdown of heavy fermions in moiré semiconductors.

Two-dimensional bismuth (Bi) is a promising platform for quantum and energy technologies due to strong spin-orbit coupling, high thermoelectric efficiency, and magnetoresistance. However, scalable and flexible synthesis of high-quality Bi with fast research turnaround remains challenging. We report a controlled colloidal synthesis of Bi nanosheets with tunable lateral sizes (0.6 - 4.1 um), hexagonal shape, and a layered single-crystalline structure along the {00l} planes. The nanosheets exhibit excellent oxidation resistance and ambient stability. ARPES measurements on individual nanosheets reveal a band structure in excellent agreement with DFT calculations, confirming high crystal quality and uniformity. Our findings enable fast production and characterization of two-dimensional Bi, paving the way for fundamental studies and integration into next-generation quantum and energy devices.

## Phase-Rotated Altermagnets as Chern Valves for Topological Transport

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>

Motivated by the emerging control of Berry-curvature textures in altermagnets, we explore a two-terminal configuration where a topological-insulator film is interfaced with two altermagnetic electrodes whose crystalline phases can be rotated independently. The proximity coupling imprints each momentum-dependent of the altermagnet spin texture onto the Dirac surface states, giving rise to an angular mass whose sign follows the lattice orientation. Adjusting the phase of one electrode redefines this mass pattern, thereby tuning the number and spatial distribution of chiral edge channels. This results in discrete conductance steps and a reversible inversion of the thermoelectric coefficient-achieved without external magnetic fields or net magnetization. A compact Dirac model captures both the quantized switching and its resilience to moderate disorder. Overall, this symmetry-driven mechanism provides a practical and low-dissipation route to programmable topological transport via lattice rotation.

## Interplay between Cu diffusion and bonding anisotropy on the thermoelectric performance of double cation chalcohalides $CuBiSeX_{2} (X = Cl, Br)$

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>

Double cation chalcohalide have recently been emerged as the interesting candidates for sustainable energy conversion applications, owing to their intrinsic chemical tunability, suitable band gap, and low thermal conductivity. With this motivation, the current study is designed to explore the structural, electron and phonon transport mechanism, and thermoelectric properties of $CuBiSeX_{2} (X = Cl, Br)$ through density functional theory-based computations. The experimental feasibility of the compounds is ensured, and they are predicted to be thermally, dynamically, and mechanically stable. The distinct structural attributes coupled with suitable electronic band structure promotes the electron transport properties. Comprehensively, the delocalized Cu atom enhancing the phonon scattering process and the off-centred displacement of cations leading to bonding anharmonicity results ultra-low lattice thermal conductivity $(κ_L)$. Among these systems, $CuBiSeCl_2$ exhibits low $κ_L$ (0.24 $W m^{-1} K^{-1}$ at 300 K) and superior thermoelectric performance (zT = 1.18 at 600 K), whereas $CuBiSeBr_2$ ($κ_L$ = 0.65 $W m^{-1} K^{-1}$ at 300 K, zT = 0.68 at 600 K) demands further optimization. Overall, the study sheds light into the interplay between the Cu diffusion and bonding anisotropy in phonon propagation and establishes the potential of double-cation chalcohalides for mid-temperature thermoelectric applications.

## Strong Intra- and Interchain Orbital Coupling Leads to Multiband and High Thermoelectric Performance in Na$_2$Au$X$ ($X$ = P, As, Sb, and Bi)

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>

The intrinsic coupling among electrical conductivity ($σ$), Seebeck coefficient ($S$), and lattice thermal conductivity ($κ_{\mathrm{L}}$) imposes a fundamental limit on the dimensionless figure of merit $ZT$ in thermoelectric (TE) materials. Increasing band degeneracy can effectively balance $σ$ and $S$, enabling a high power factor (PF, $S^{2}σ$). However, compounds with intrinsically large band degeneracy are scarce. Here, we present an unconventional strategy to realize elevated band degeneracy in zigzag-chain Na$_2$Au$X$ ($X$ = P, As, Sb, Bi) compounds by harnessing strong intra- and interchain orbital coupling. Pronounced hybridization between Au-$d_{z^{2}}$ and $X$-$p_{z}$ orbitals along the Au--$X$ zigzag chains, together with unexpectedly strong interchain $X$-$p_{x}/p_{y}$ coupling, produces a highly dispersive, multivalley valence band structure that supports an exceptional PF. Concurrently, the intrinsically weak interchain interactions arising from the quasi-one-dimensional framework, together with the weakened Au--$X$ and Au--Au bonds within the chains due to filling of $p$-$d^{*}$ antibonding states, result in an ultralow $κ_{\mathrm{L}}$. First-principles calculations combined with Boltzmann transport theory predict that $p$-type Na$_2$AuBi achieves a PF of $63.9\,μ\mathrm{W}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-1}\,\mathrm{K}^{-2}$, an ultralow $κ_{\mathrm{L}}$ of $0.49\,\mathrm{W}\,\mathrm{m}^{-1}\,\mathrm{K}^{-1}$, and a maximum $ZT$ of $4.7$ along the zigzag-chain direction at $800\,\mathrm{K}$. This work establishes a new design paradigm for high-efficiency TE materials by exploiting substantial orbital overlap in structurally weakly bonded, quasi-one-dimensional systems, opening promising avenues for the discovery and engineering of next-generation high-performance TE materials.

Quantum heat engines are nanoscale devices that convert heat into work by exploiting quantum effects, such as coherence and interference. Previous studies of these devices did not consider spin-dependent effects, which can influence the thermoelectric performance of the engine. In this work, we study the thermoelectric behavior of a quantum heat engine based on an Aharonov-Bohm ring - a mesoscopic ring where electrons exhibit interference depending on the magnetic flux it encloses - incorporating Rashba spin-orbit interaction (SOI), which couples the electron's motion and spin. We find that Rashba SOI enhances the figure of merit $ZT$, measure of the engine's conversion efficiency. Our results suggest that controlling spin-dependent interference could lead to improvements in the fabrication of efficient thermoelectric devices.

## Thermoelectric transport and the role of different scattering processes in the half-Heusler NbFeSb

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>

We perform an ab initio computational investigation of the electronic and thermoelectric transport properties of one of the best performance half-Heusler (HH) alloys, NbFeSb. We use Boltzmann Transport equation while taking into account the full energy/momentum/band dependence of all relevant electronic scattering rates, i.e. with acoustic phonons, non-polar optical phonons (intra- and inter-valley), polar optical phonons (POP), and ionized impurity scattering (IIS). We use a highly efficient and accurate computational approach, where the scattering rates are derived using only a few ab initio extracted matrix elements, while we account fully for intra-/inter valley/band transitions, screening from both electrons and holes, and bipolar transport effects. Our computed thermoelectric power-factor (PF) values show good agreement with experiments across densities and temperatures, while they indicate the upper limit of PF performance for this material. We show that the polar optical phonon and ionized impurity scattering (importantly including screening), influence significantly the transport properties, whereas the computationally expensive non-polar phonon scattering part (acoustic and non-polar optical) is somewhat weaker, especially for electrons, and at lower to intermediate temperatures. This insight is relevant in the study of half-Heusler and other polar thermoelectric materials in general. Although we use NbFeSb as an example, the method we employ is material agnostic and can be broadly applied efficiently for electronic and thermoelectric materials in general, with more than 10x reduction in computational cost compared to fully ab initio methods, while retaining ab-initio accuracy.

## Thermal Transport in Ag8TS6 (T= Si, Ge, Sn) Argyrodites: An Integrated Experimental, Quantum-Chemical, and Computational Modelling Study

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>

Argyrodite-type Ag-based sulfides combine exceptionally low lattice thermal and high ionic conductivity, making them promising candidates for thermoelectric and solid-state energy applications. In this work, we studied Ag8TS6 (T= Si, Ge, Sn) argyrodite family by combining chemical-bonding analysis, lattice vibrational properties simulation, and experimental measurements to investigate their structural and thermal transport properties. Furthermore, we propose a two-channel lattice-dynamics model based on Grüneisen-derived phonon lifetimes and compare it to an approach using machine-learned interatomic potentials. Both approaches are able to predict thermal conductivity in agreement with experimental lattice thermal conductivities along the whole temperature range, highlighting their potential suitability for future high-throughput predictions. Our findings also reveal a relationship between bond heterogeneity arising from weakly bonded Ag+ ions and occupied antibonding states in Ag-S and Ag-Ag interactions and strong anharmonicity, including large Grüneisen parameters, and low sound velocities, which are responsible for the low lattice thermal conductivity of Ag8SnS6, Ag8GeS6, and Ag8SiS6. We furthermore show that thermal and ionic conductivities in all three compounds are independent of each other and can likely be tuned individually.

We investigate the thermoelectric transport properties of an interacting parallel double quantum dot in the Coulomb-blockade regime. Building on an analytical solution based on an equation-of-motion technique, we extend the formalism for the asymmetrically coupled situation and provide compact closed-form expressions for steady-state currents together with the differential conductance, Seebeck coefficient, and thermal conductance. We determine the operating points that maximize efficiency and output power of the system, clarifying their relation to standard near-equilibrium ZT expressions. We further study the thermal rectification in both the open- and closed-circuit configurations and derive an expression for the open-circuit case. Interaction-induced resonances are understood in terms of the poles of the resulting Green's function, generating gate and bias dependent regions of enhanced efficiency at finite power, negative differential thermal conductance, and finite thermal rectification.

Rectification properties of semiconductor p-n junction diodes are the basic and important characteristics for electronic device evaluation, especially for novel semiconductor materials. Today's semiconductor devices' fabrication and integration processes require multibillion-dollar investments and are desired to be reduced or simplified. Therefore, low-cost and non-toxic base metal materials with simple fabrication methods are desired for the future semiconductor industry. Recently, copper-based sulfides have been studied for semiconductor devices such as thermoelectric, photovoltaic, or water-splitting applications. Here, a highly rectifying p-n diode of a cubic (disordered) phase Cu4Fe5S8 polycrystal with a zincblende-like structure fabricated by a simple/low-cost wet process is shown. It is found that the Cu4Fe5S8 diode shows the highest rectification ratio in the order of 106 with a large forward current density of 15 Acm-2 (@1.5 V forward bias) at room temperature among the other compounds of copper iron sulfide devices. This remarkable and stable diode characteristic obtained by the p-type layer anodically grown on the sintered n-type cubic-Cu4Fe5S8 can bring the industry closer to low-cost semiconductor manufacturing. These results open a platform of novel semiconductor materials such as cubic-Cu4Fe5S8 with further superior crystal growth and conductive characteristics.

A development effort to improve the performance of superconducting radio-frequency half-wave resonators (SRF HWRs) is underway at the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB), where 220 such resonators are in operation. Our goal was to achieve an intrinsic quality factor (Q0) of >= 2E10 at an accelerating gradient (Ea) of 12 MV/m. FRIB production resonators were prepared with buffered chemical polishing (BCP). First trials on electropolishing (EP) and post-EP low temperature baking (LTB) of FRIB HWRs allowed us to reach higher gradient (15 MV/m, limited by quench) with a higher quality factor at high gradient, but Q0 was still below our goal. Trapped magnetic flux during the Dewar test was found to be a source of Q0 reduction. Three strategies were used to reduce the trapped flux: (i) adding a local magnetic shield (LMGS) to supplement the ``global'' magnetic shield around the Dewar for reduction of the ambient magnetic field; (ii) performing a ``uniform cool-down'' (UC) to reduce the thermoelectric currents; and (iii) using a compensation coil to further reduce the ambient field with active field cancellation (AFC). The LMGS improved the Q0, but not enough to reach our goal. With UC and AFC, we exceeded our goal, reaching Q0 = 2.8E10 at Ea = 12 MV/m.

## Interplay of Magnetism, Band Gap Tuning, Optical, and Thermoelectric Responses in Fe-Doped YMnO$_3$: Insights from First-Principles Calculations

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>

The hexagonal multiferroic oxide YMnO$_3$ has demonstrated applications in various fields and is widely researched due to its interesting properties. Since Mn(3d)--O(2p) interactions predominate close to the Fermi level, doping in the B-site (Mn) with Fe provides a way to modulate the band gap and magnetic order of YMnO$_3$. The need for a lead-free ferroelectric material with a narrow band gap is crucial for absorbing a wide range of the solar spectrum. Density functional theory calculations were carried out using GGA and meta-GGA (for an accurate description of the band gap) exchange correlation functional for the Fe-doped YMnO$_3$ multiferroics. Various magnetic configurations were analyzed, finding collinear G-type AFM as the least energy state. The hexagonal lattice is retained after Fe doping with slight distortions and a change in lattice constants. Fe doping reduces spin frustration and induces magnetization, while reducing the band gap from 1.88 eV for pure to 1.19 eV for a 25 percent doping concentration. Additionally, Fe doping exhibits an enhanced dielectric response, characterized by an increase in the static dielectric constant and the presence of strong absorption peaks in the visible and UV energy ranges. Thermoelectric studies illustrate enhanced conductivity due to increased charge carriers induced by doping. In summary, first-principles predictions of structural, electronic, optical, and transport behavior in Fe-doped YMnO$_3$ provide a foundation for tailoring this oxide in photovoltaic, thermoelectric, and optoelectronic applications.

In this study, we investigate the structural properties, chemical stability, and electronic, optical, and thermoelectric properties of $\mathrm{Sr_2PrSbO_6}$ using first-principles calculations based on Density Functional Theory (DFT). The goal of this study is to evaluate its potential contribution to next-generation electrocatalysts, optoelectronic devices, and thermoelectric systems. The structural optimization reveals that $\mathrm{Sr_2PrSbO_6}$ crystallizes in a stable cubic perovskite structure with space group $Fm\bar{3}m$. The calculated formation energy indicates high thermodynamic stability, confirming the viability of $\mathrm{Sr_2PrSbO_6}$ for practical applications. The electronic band structure calculations show that $\mathrm{Sr_2PrSbO_6}$ is a wide bandgap semiconductor with a direct bandgap of $3.488~\mathrm{eV}$ at the $Γ$-point. The calculated density of states (DOS) indicates significant contributions from O $2p$, Sb $5p$, and Pr $5d$ orbitals. Optical property calculations, including the dielectric function and absorption coefficient, reveal strong absorption in the UV regions, making $\mathrm{Sr_2PrSbO_6}$ a promising candidate for optoelectronic applications such as UV light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and photovoltaic-thermoelectric (PV-TE) tandem systems. At room temperature, the calculated dimensionless quantity $ZT$ is $0.33$, which indicates this material as a possible candidate for thermoelectric applications. Our results will serve as a benchmark for future experimental and theoretical research on the properties of this material.

In this work, we present a novel investigation into the spin-dependent thermoelectric performance of an extended Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model, showcasing for the first time how its intrinsic spin filtration mechanism can be strategically harnessed to function as an efficient spin thermoelectric generator. By introducing a Fibonacci-type aperiodic modulation in the onsite energies, we engineer a deterministic disorder that mimics realistic aperiodic systems and profoundly influences transport characteristics. Furthermore, we incorporate both nearest-neighbor (NN) and next-nearest-neighbor (NNN) hopping amplitudes with tunable cosine dependencies, enabling us to meticulously explore the intricate interplay between these hopping processes and its implications on thermoelectric behavior. Our analysis reveals a remarkable enhancement in the dimensionless thermoelectric figure of merit ZT for both charge and spin transport channels, under carefully optimized conditions. Notably, the spin thermoelectric response exhibits distinct advantages, opening a new frontier in the design of next-generation thermoelectric materials and devices. This qualitative study not only deepens our understanding of aperiodic topological systems but also establish a foundational framework for exploiting spin-based thermoelectricity in low-dimensional platforms.

Sesqui-chalcogenides serve as a critical bridge between traditional semiconductors and quantum materials, offering significant potential in applications such as thermoelectrics, phase change memory, and topological insulators. While considerable attention has been focused on antimony- and bismuth-based compounds, characterized by substantial property changes upon reduction in film thickness, indium containing sesqui-chalcogenides like In$_2$Te$_3$ are emerging as promising candidates for photovoltaics and electronic devices. However, the effects of film thickness on the properties of In$_2$Te$_3$ remain largely unexplored. In this study, we investigate high-quality In$_2$Te$_3$ thin films grown by molecular beam epitaxy on Si(111) substrates across a thickness range from 2.7 nm to 24 nm. We employ X-ray diffraction, reflective high-energy electron diffraction and atomic force microscopy to analyze both the crystal structure and film morphology. Additionally, we utilize broadband optical spectroscopy alongside femtosecond pump-probe measurements and Raman spectroscopy to assess optical and vibrational properties, respectively. Our analysis reveals that material properties exhibit minimal dependence on film thickness, contrasting sharply with behavior observed in other chalcogenides such as Sb$_2$Te$_3$, Bi$_2$Se$_3$, or GeTe. This phenomenon can be attributed to covalent bonding present in In$_2$Te$_3$, which differs from those in its antimony- and bismuth-containing counterparts.

Improving energy efficiency by recovering waste heat and providing thermal protection is of high technological importance. This work investigates the chalcogenide compounds CdGa2Te4 and ZnGa2Te4 using density functional theory and BoltzTraP2 calculations. Both materials are dynamically stable, brittle, and elastically anisotropic. Electronic structure calculations show direct band gaps that range from 1.0 to 2.2 electronvolt. Carrier effective masses are favorable, with CdGa2Te4 showing light electrons equal to 0.21 times the free electron mass and ZnGa2Te4 showing moderately heavy carriers equal to 0.39 times the free electron mass. Thermoelectric transport calculations yield large Seebeck coefficients of about 108 to 119 microvolt per kelvin. The thermoelectric figure of merit ZT increases from about 0.4 at 50 K to about 0.78 at 800 kelvin, indicating promising thermoelectric performance. For thermal barrier coating applications, both compounds combine ultralow lattice thermal conductivity with moderate melting points around 790 to 850 K and small thermal expansion coefficients, which helps resist thermal stress. Overall, CdGa2Te4 and ZnGa2Te4 are multifunctional materials suitable for efficient waste heat recovery and durable thermal barrier operation below 900 K.

## Thermal Conductivity Estimation of Thermoelectric Materials with Uncertainty Quantification Using Bayesian Physics-Informed Neural Networks

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>

Characterizing the temperature-dependent thermal conductivity is challenging because the property varies strongly with temperature and reliable heat flow measurement, not just temperature sensing, is difficult under experimental conditions. Here, we present a physics informed deep learning framework that infers conductivity solely from sparse electric potential measurements. We first develop a deterministic physics-informed neural network (PINN) that embeds coupled thermoelectric transport equations as soft constraints, enabling simultaneous recovery of spatial temperature, voltage, and conductivity profiles without temperature data. The deterministic PINN achieves accurate inference under noise-free conditions, yet its predictions degrade when measurement noise is introduced. To address this, we extend the framework to a Bayesian PINN, which models network parameters probabilistically and employs Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) sampling for posterior inference. This extension produces robust thermal conductivity estimates and, importantly, provides credible intervals that quantify uncertainty from sparse and noisy data. Numerical experiments confirm that the Bayesian PINN not only preserves predictive accuracy under noise but also reveals inference bias and enables uncertainty aware interpretation of material properties. Together, the deterministic and Bayesian formulations establish a scalable and generalizable alternative to conventional methods for determining temperature-dependent properties, offering physics- consistent and risk-aware property inference for thermoelectric systems and other functional materials where direct temperature sensing is impractical

## Synergistic modulation of band structure and phonon transport for higher thermoelectric performance of WSe2

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>

Tungsten diselenide (WSe2) emerges as a promising thermoelectric (TE) candidate due to its high thermopower (S), cost-effectiveness, and environmentally friendly characteristics. However, pristine WSe2 exhibits limited electrical conductivity (sigma), a low power factor (PF), and high lattice thermal conductivity (k_L), which restrict its overall TE performance. Here, we show that through co-doping of Nb for W and Te for Se in WSe2, its power factor increases 17-fold, reaching 8.91 microW cm^-1 K^-2 at 850 K. Simultaneously, its lattice thermal conductivity (k_L) decreases from 1.70 W m^-1 K^-1 to 0.48 W m^-1 K^-1. Experiments and density functional theory (DFT) analysis demonstrate that the enhancement of PF is linked to an increased density of states, higher effective mass (md*), improved mobility (mu), and elevated electrical conductivity (sigma) owing to the replacement of Se2- with Te2-; while the observed 72% reduction in k_L results primarily from phonon scattering at Te-Se and Nb-W defects. As a result, a remarkable ZT_max ~ 1 is obtained at 850 K for the sample W0.95Nb0.05Se2-yTey with y = 0.3, which is about a 30-fold increase compared to WSe2, proving that Nb and Te co-doping in WSe2 can significantly boost its TE performance.

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>

Thermomechanical infrared (IR) detectors have emerged as promising alternatives to traditional photon and thermoelectric sensors, offering broadband sensitivity and low noise without the need for cryogenic cooling. Despite recent advances, the field still lacks a unified framework to guide the design of these nanomechanical systems. This work addresses that gap by providing a comprehensive design guide for IR thermal detectors based on silicon nitride drumhead and trampolines. Leveraging a validated analytical model, we systematically explore how geometry, tensile stress, and optical properties influence key performance metrics such as thermal time constant, noise-equivalent power, and specific detectivity. The analysis encompasses both bare silicon nitride and structures with broadband absorber layers, revealing how different parameter regimes affect the trade-off between sensitivity and response speed. Rather than focusing on a single device architecture, this study maps out a broad design space, enabling performance prediction and optimisation for a variety of application requirements. As such, it serves not only as a reference for benchmarking existing devices but also as a practical tool for engineering next-generation IR sensors that can operate close to the fundamental detection limit. This work is intended as a foundational resource for researchers and designers aiming to tailor IR detectors to specific use cases.

## Unique Hierarchical Rotational Dynamics Induces Ultralow Lattice Thermal Conductivity in Cyanide-bridged Framework Materials

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>

The pursuit of materials combining light constituent elements with ultralow lattice thermal conductivity ($κ_{\mathrm{L}}$) is crucial to advancing technologies like thermoelectrics and thermal barrier coatings, yet it remains a formidable challenge to date. Herein, we achieve ultralow $κ_{\mathrm{L}}$ in lightweight cyanide-bridged framework materials (CFMs) through the rational integration of properties such as the hierarchical vibrations exhibited in superatomic structures and rotational dynamics exhibited in perovskites. Unique hierarchical rotation behavior leads to multiple negative peaks in Grüneisen parameters across a wide frequency range, thereby inducing pronounced negative thermal expansion and strong cubic anharmonicity in CFMs. Meanwhile, the synergistic effect between large four-phonon scattering phase space (induced by phonon quasi-flat bands and wide bandgaps) and strong quartic anharmonicity (associated with rotation modes) leads to giant quartic anharmonic scattering rates in these materials. Consequently, the $κ_{\mathrm{L}}$ of these CFMs decreases by one to two orders of magnitude compared to the known perovskites or perovskite-like materials with equivalent average atomic masses. For instance, the Cd(CN)$_{2}$, NaB(CN)$_{4}$, LiIn(CN)$_{4}$, and AgX(CN)$_{4}$ (X = B, Al, Ga, In) exhibit ultralow room-temperature $κ_{\mathrm{L}}$ values ranging from 0.35 to 0.81 W/mK. This work not only establishes CFMs as a novel and rich platform for studying extreme phonon anharmonicity, but also provides a new paradigm for achieving ultralow thermal conductivity in lightweight materials via the conscious integration of hierarchical and rotational dynamics.

## Impurity-induced spin density wave in the thermoelectric layered cobaltite [Ca$_2$CoO$_3$]$_{0.62}$[CoO$_2$]

We investigate the Sn-substitution effect on the thermoelectric transport properties of the layered cobaltite [Ca$_2$CoO$_3$]$_{0.62}$[CoO$_2$] single crystals, which exhibit a non-monotonic temperature variation of the electrical resistivity and the Seebeck coefficient owing to the complex electronic and magnetic states. We find that the onset temperature of the short-range spin-density-wave (SDW) formation increases with the substituted Sn content, indicating the impurity-induced stabilization of the SDW order, reminiscent of the disorder/impurity-induced spin order in the cuprate superconductors. The Seebeck coefficient is well related to such impurity effects, as it is slightly enhanced below the onset temperatures, implying a decrease in the carrier concentration due to a pseudo-gap formation associated with the SDW ordering. We discuss the site-dependent substitution effects including earlier studies, and suggest that substitution to the conducting CoO$_2$ layers is essential to increase the onset temperature, consistent with the impurity-induced SDW picture realized in the conducting layers with the cylindrical Fermi surface.
